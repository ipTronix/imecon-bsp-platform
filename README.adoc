To get the BSP you need to have repo installed and use it as:

Install the repo utility:

$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir 3b6-bsp
$: cd 3b6-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/ipTronix/3b6-bsp-platform -b jethro
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

$: source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at fsl-community-bsp/sources.
